      <h3>Here's some info about his background</h3>
      <ul>
        <li id="points">In 1972, David and his twin brother Eli were born as a result of the secret government project "Les Enfants Terribles,"[8] designed to create the perfect soldier, using the genes of the "Greatest Warrior of the 20th Century" Big Boss. The twins were also to serve as an insurance policy for the Patriots, should Big Boss abandon their organization.</li>
        <li id="points">Following his birth, Solid Snake was given the name David. He spent his early life being raised in the United States by a variety of foster parents.</li>
        <li id="points">Later, David joined Big Boss's special forces unit FOXHOUND, during which time he received the codename "Solid Snake." While undergoing FOXHOUND's training regimen, he became an expert of high-altitude skydiving, linguistics, closed-circuit open-circuit combat diving, and free climbing.</li>
        <li id="points">Snake was later scouted by the CIA and spent six months as an undercover agent, until he became dissatisfied with the organization and left. He then became a mercenary for hire, and after earning enough money, he went into semi-retirement in the Canadian wilderness.</li>
        <li id="points"> December 1999, Snake was called upon by FOXHOUND’s new commander, Roy Campbell, for an operation into Central Asia. Apparently, a new highly militarized nation called Zanzibar Land had kidnapped Dr. Kio Marv, inventor of the oil refining microbe, OILIX</li>
        </ul>
